		<description><p><strong>Range.</strong> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers.

You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><strong>Ammunition.</strong> You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p><p><strong>Heavy.</strong> Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.</p><p><strong>Strong-Draw.</strong> An advanced ranged weapon with the strong-draw quality requires great strength to use. You must have a Strength of 13 or higher to use such a weapon, or you make attack rolls using the weapon with disadvantage.

If you have a free hand when you score a critical hit this way, you can disarm the target so that you end up with the dropped weapon in your hand.

		<description>
			<p>A two-handed, double weapon functions as two light weapons, one in each hand, for two-weapon fighting purposes. If a double weapon has the reach property, you can use only one of these properties during the same turn.</p>

	<element name="Entangling" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_ENTANGLING">
		<description>
			<p>An entangling weapon can tie a target up. When you hit with an entangling weapon attack against a target no more than one size larger than you, you can use your bonus action to attempt to grapple the target. (This bonus-action use applies when you throw an entangling weapon because you’re throwing with special preparation.) You don’t need a free hand—the weapon fulfills that requirement. If you succeed, the target is grappled by you or the weapon if you’re no longer holding it.</p>
            <p>Until the grapple ends, you can’t use the entangling weapon to attack a different target. If you aren’t holding the entangling weapon, such as when you throw a gladiator net, the grapple continues, and the target needs to succeed at a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check to escape the weapon.</p>

	<element name="Guard" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_GUARD">
		<description>
			<p>Guard weapons allow you to fight defensively, using the weapon’s long haft or flat surface for parrying. While you wield a guard weapon, whenever a hostile creature moves within your reach when you didn’t move on your last turn, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack with the guard weapon against that creature. If the attack hits, then it deals no damage, but the target immediately stops moving, and its speed becomes 0 until the end of its turn.</p>

	<element name="Hafted" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_HAFTED">
		<description>
			<p>A hafted weapon’s haft can function well as an off-hand attack. When you attack with only the hafted weapon, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the haft. The haft deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage, and you add your ability modifier to damage as you would for other sorts of two-weapon fighting. If you have feats that mimic this ability, the damage dice becomes 1d8 instead.</p>

	<element name="Magazine" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_MAGAZINE">
		<description>
			<p>A weapon with the magazine property also has a number and an ammunition type. The weapon holds that amount and type of ammo, which you can expend before needing to reload the weapon. Removing or loading a magazine counts as your interaction with an object, so doing both in one turn takes an action. A magazine weapon comes with one empty magazine included in the weapon’s cost and weight. Loading an empty magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute.</p>

	<element name="Momentum" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_MOMENTUM">
		<description>
			<p>Momentum weapons allow you to deliver devastating attacks as part of rapid movement. When you hit a creature with a momentum weapon after you moved 20 feet or more in a straight line during the same turn, upgrade the damage dice to the weapon’s momentum dice value.</p>

	<element name="Precise" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_PRECISE">
		<description>
			<p>When you attack with a precise weapon, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If a feature or item you have increases the numbers you can roll for a critical hit, a precise weapon increases that range by one. A fighter with Superior Critical, for instance, scores a critical hit on a roll of 17 to 20 with a precise weapon. Any roll lower than 20 must still hit to be a critical hit—it’s not an automatic hit as if the roll was a 20.</p>

	<element name="Repeater" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_REPEATER">
		<description>
			   <p>Repeater weapons can fire ammo in quick succession, using multiple barrels or quick-reloading mechanisms. When you take the attack action with a repeater weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack again with the same weapon. You add your ability modifier to the damage the bonus-action shot only if that modifier is negative.</p>

	<element name="Restraining" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_RESTRAINING">
		<description>
			<p>Only entangling weapons can be restraining weapons. If you have a target grappled with a restraining weapon, and you succeed on another attempt to grapple the target with the same weapon, the target becomes restrained instead of grappled. The target then remains restrained until the grapple ends. If you stop holding the restraining weapon, the target can escape as if from an unheld entangling weapon.</p>

	<element name="Returning" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_RETURNING">
		<description>
			<p>A returning weapon allows you to hurl the weapon in such a way that it returns to you. When you attack with a returning weapon, if you roll an even number on the d20, the weapon returns to you by the end of your turn. You can catch the weapon if you have a hand free to do so. If not, the weapon lands at a random point within 5 feet of you. If you roll an odd number on the d20 for the attack roll, the weapon fails to return to you.</p>

	<element name="Scatter" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_SCATTER">
		<description>
			<p>Scatter weapons can devastate multiple enemies at once. When you take the Attack action and hit a creature with a scatter weapon, measure the weapon’s scatter range from the square the target you hit occupies to a point farther from you. Creatures other than the original target that fall within the weapon’s scatter range must attempt a Dexterity saving throw (DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability score modifier you use to determine damage for the scatter weapon). Creatures that fail take damage equal to the ability score modifier you use to determine damage with the weapon (minimum 1). This damage is of the same type you dealt to the original target.</p>

	<element name="Set" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_SET">
		<description>
			<p>You can use a bonus action on your turn to prepare, or “set,” a set weapon against a foe moving toward you. A weapon becomes unset if you move or take any action after setting it. If a target enters your reach while you have the weapon set, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the set weapon against that target. If you hit, and your target moved 20 feet or more toward you before the attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the damage total.</p>

	<element name="Strong-Draw" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_STRONG_DRAW">
		<description>
			<p>An advanced ranged weapon with the strong-draw quality requires great strength to use. You must have a Strength of 13 or higher to use such a weapon, or you make attack rolls using the weapon with disadvantage. You add not only your Dexterity modifier to damage with a strong-draw weapon, but you also add 1 + half your Strength Modifier (rounded down) to the damage.</p>

			<p>Swift weapons help you recover quickly from misses. When you miss with a swift weapon, you gain advantage on the first attack roll you make with the weapon against the same target before the end of your next turn.</p>

	<element name="Tripping" type="Weapon Property" source="Additions by Jay" id="ID_GFG_GHPG_WEAPON_PROPERTY_TRIPPING">
		<description>
			<p>A tripping weapon allows users to knock targets prone. When you hit with a tripping weapon, you can use a bonus action to force your target to attempt a Strength saving throw, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). If the target fails, it falls prone.</p>
